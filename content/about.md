I defended my Ph.D. in 2013, which was a deep-dive
into a particular [motion planning algorithm for non-linear systems](https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/3c186bc7-cb13-4b1c-b3b1-b5f74f1877fa/content).

After grad school, I started in the storage device industry,
where I worked on data science-type problems related to disk drive manufacturing.  In 2022, I moved
to Apple's Special Projects Group, to work on the [ill-fated Apple Car
project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_car_project).
