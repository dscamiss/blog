I defended my Ph.D. in 2013, which was a deep-dive
into [motion planning for non-linear systems](https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/3c186bc7-cb13-4b1c-b3b1-b5f74f1877fa/content).

After grad school, I went to [Western Digital](https://www.wdc.com/),
where I worked on data science problems related to disk drive manufacturing.
In 2022, I moved to Apple's Special Projects Group (SPG) to work on the [Apple Car
project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_car_project).
